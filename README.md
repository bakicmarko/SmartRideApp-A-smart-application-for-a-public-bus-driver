Digitalized transit has become a key part of transit accessibility and the way of
movement. With its development, new terms like on-demand services and mobility as
a service, MaaS emerge. On-demand service in transit represents a type of service
which allows the passenger to control the main parts of the travel, while mobility as a
service combines already existing solutions of public and private digitalized transit into
a unique system in which the passenger is enabled to organize the travel in its entirety.
In this thesis, a research of existing solutions for digitalized transit has been conducted
and a solution for digitalizing transit for bus drivers has been modeled. Based on the
presented model, the design has been implemented in Figma and the prototype of the
mobile application has been built in Flutter.
